# Decision Flows and Memory Lifecycle

This page is a **visual map of existing Agent Memory doctrine and explicitly scoped implementation evidence**. It is not a new doctrine source, decision table, runtime guarantee, or substitute for the canonical numbered documentation and ADR maturity process.

Use each diagram to answer one architectural question, then follow the canonical or evidence source link when implementation or conformance depends on the exact contract.

## Reading rule

The diagrams deliberately preserve distinctions that are easy to destroy through visual simplification:

```text
confidence != truth
saturation != confidence
saturation != authority
relevance != permission
certification != permanence forever
staleness != falsity
supersession != correction
delete operation != forgetting completeness
retrieval != recall admission
same agent != same memory scope
proposal != commit
valid signature != permission
valid execution != authorization
valid DEL != forgetting
```

When a visual and a canonical document appear to differ, **the canonical document governs**. When an evidence-scoped visual and its executed evidence differ, the executed evidence governs and the diagram must be corrected. Open an issue rather than treating a picture as an independent policy or runtime claim.

## 1. Memory lifecycle state map

**Question:** How can retained state strengthen, weaken, be disputed, corrected, reconciled, or pruned?

  </picture>
</p>

Not every memory traverses every state. `Crystallized` is durable under current evidence and policy, not eternal. `Pruned` removes memory from active recall or durable lifecycle consideration according to policy and does not necessarily mean physical deletion.

**Canonical contract:** [`docs/02-lifecycle-state-machine.md`](https://github.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/blob/main/docs/02-lifecycle-state-machine.md)

## 2. Strength and stability dynamics

**Question:** Which signals strengthen or weaken a memory's case for persistence without creating authority?

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/strength-stability-flow.svg">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/strength-stability-flow-light.svg">

  </picture>
</p>

Evidence, verification, corroboration, meaningful reuse, and stable provenance can strengthen the case for persistence. Contradiction, expiry, invalidation, uncertainty, and drift can weaken it. Neither direction grants authority to promote, share, execute, or delete. Exact operating thresholds remain calibrated implementation choices rather than doctrine.

## 3. PAMA mutation-authority decision flow

**Question:** What authority outcome is allowed for a proposed mutation?

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/pama-decision-flow.svg">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/pama-decision-flow-light.svg">

  </picture>
</p>

PAMA is multidimensional governance, not a single memory-quality score. Target class, lifecycle strength, requested operation, downstream authority, consequence, actor, evidence, uncertainty, and policy remain distinct. Confidence or saturation can contribute evidence but cannot expand an otherwise prohibited authority envelope.

**Readable Wiki context:** [PAMA](PAMA)

## 4. Governed recall pipeline

**Question:** Which retrieved candidates may enter active context, and under what treatment?

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/governed-recall-flow.svg">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/governed-recall-flow-light.svg">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/governed-recall-flow-light.svg" alt="Governed recall pipeline showing request resolution, candidate generation and normalization, recall admission, ranking only among admitted candidates, composition risk, context budgeting, governed assembly, and recall explanation" width="100%">
  </picture>
</p>

Candidate generation may be probabilistic. Admission is governed. Ranking occurs only among admitted candidates, composition has its own policy boundary, and context budgeting cannot discard required governance state. A stronger retrieval score never reopens a blocked candidate.

## 5. Temporal change, correction, and supersession

**Question:** How should readers distinguish supersession, correction, dispute, and staleness across time?

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/temporal-correction-flow.svg">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/temporal-correction-flow-light.svg">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/temporal-correction-flow-light.svg" alt="Temporal change diagram distinguishing historically true state that is later superseded, wrong or incomplete state that is corrected, uncertain state that is disputed, and old but historically valid state that is stale for current-state recall" width="100%">
  </picture>
</p>

Supersession preserves a previously valid state while a newer state becomes current. Correction records that an earlier claim was wrong or materially incomplete within its claimed scope or time. Dispute preserves unresolved uncertainty. Staleness can reduce current-state usefulness without converting historical truth into falsity. Exact chronology does not establish causality, and inferred causal links must not rewrite the historical event log.

## 6. Deletion completeness and derived-state propagation

**Question:** Why can a successful delete operation still leave memory behind?

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/deletion-propagation-flow.svg">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/deletion-propagation-flow-light.svg">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/deletion-propagation-flow-light.svg" alt="Deletion completeness diagram showing canonical memory, governed derived memory and projection state, correction staleness versus deletion residue, transitive purge, independent residue verification, and incomplete forgetting when undeclared residue survives" width="100%">
  </picture>
</p>

Canonical deletion doctrine requires propagation through known derivation relationships and verification of the requested forgetting outcome. The diagram's three-tier projection vocabulary, transitive-closure mechanics, and `stale`/`residual` relation come from **executed P4 design evidence that is not ADR-adopted doctrine**. That distinction is deliberate. The tested design makes the key failure mode legible without pretending its supporting ADR has matured: source change creates staleness; source purge can create residual content; and a row-level delete cannot prove forgetting completeness.

## 7. Executable scenario walkthroughs

**Question:** What do these boundaries look like when the repository's fixtures exercise them?

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/scenario-walkthroughs-flow.svg">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/scenario-walkthroughs-flow-light.svg">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/scenario-walkthroughs-flow-light.svg" alt="Three governed-memory scenarios showing a supported memory entering pending verification rather than self-promoting, a highly confident false claim blocked from crystallization, and a raw deletion failing the forgetting outcome because derived residue survives" width="100%">
  </picture>
</p>

These are not hypothetical new policies. They are reader-oriented projections of existing conformance fixtures. [`governed-promotion-audit-trace.json`](https://github.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/blob/main/fixtures/governed-promotion-audit-trace.json) shows corroboration, cross-reference, reuse, proposal, authority resolution, a selected permitted action, committed `pending_verification`, and a reconstructable receipt. [`high-confidence-false-promotion.json`](https://github.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/blob/main/fixtures/high-confidence-false-promotion.json) demonstrates that confidence `0.99` and saturation `0.97` still do not permit crystallization of a false claim. [`deletion-residue.json`](https://github.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/blob/main/fixtures/deletion-residue.json) demonstrates that a deleted raw record plus surviving derived content forbids a full-deletion claim and requires continued dependency handling and verification.

The scenario set deliberately does **not** visualize cross-project isolation as settled behavior. The repository already has recall and tenant-scope negative cases, but issue #73 separately binds the isolation-domain visualization to ADR-022 maturity. Scenario convenience does not get to bypass that boundary.

## 8. Portable governance evidence chain

**Question:** How can a memory decision be evidenced externally without exporting semantic authority?

> **Maturity: executable evidence toward Proposed ADR-021.** This diagram is not an Accepted ADR visual and does not raise conformance.

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/portable-evidence-chain-flow.svg">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/main/assets/diagrams/portable-evidence-chain-flow-light.svg">

  </picture>
</p>

P4.5 local implementation now provides the executable shape issue #73 required before visualizing this boundary: a versioned content-free projection, deterministic canonicalization, Ed25519 issuer/verifier, Agent Manifest checkpoint correlation, TRACE/cMCP external-action correlation, lifecycle-result composition, and adversarial continuity vectors. The canonical Agent Memory receipt remains authoritative. Portable evidence proves integrity and correlation; it does not manufacture PAMA permission or lifecycle satisfaction. A valid negative outcome remains valid evidence.

**Proposed architectural boundary:** [ADR-021](https://github.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-021-portable-memory-governance-evidence-boundary.md)  
**Executable evidence:** [`docs/programs/runtime-evidence/portable-governance-evidence.md`](https://github.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/blob/main/docs/programs/runtime-evidence/portable-governance-evidence.md)

## What remains maturity-gated

The V1/V2 visual core, first executable scenario set, and evidence-scoped portable governance chain are represented. The remaining issue #73 visual is the isolation-domain crossing view, and that boundary is **not ready to finalize**.

[ADR-022](https://github.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-022-memory-isolation-domains-and-controlled-boundary-crossing.md) remains **Proposed**, and implementation issue [#68](https://github.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/issues/68) remains open with its canonical contract/schema/critical fixture acceptance work incomplete. The visual guide therefore stops at the existing governed-recall scope boundary rather than promoting the proposed isolation-domain model into a settled diagram.

[ADR-021](https://github.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/agent-memory/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-021-portable-memory-governance-evidence-boundary.md) also remains **Proposed** despite the executable P4.5 evidence above. A diagram does not raise an ADR status, conformance level, or runtime-evidence claim.

This page will remain an index into stable or explicitly evidence-scoped visual explanations as they land.

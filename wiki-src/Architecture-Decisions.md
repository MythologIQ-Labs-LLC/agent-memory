# Architecture Decisions

Agent Memory uses Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to preserve why important doctrine choices exist and when they should be reconsidered.

## Status semantics

ADR status describes **doctrine maturity**, not runtime implementation completeness.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Proposed | The decision is under active evaluation and has not yet met its acceptance bar. |
| Accepted | The decision is canonical doctrine for this repository. |
| Superseded | A later decision replaces it while preserving history. |
| Rejected | The proposed direction was considered and intentionally not adopted. |

An Accepted ADR does **not** mean every mapped product implements it. That would be a convenient fiction, but still a fiction.

## Current state

- **ADR-001 through ADR-020:** Accepted
- **ADR-021:** Proposed, portable memory-governance evidence boundary
- **ADR-022:** Accepted, memory isolation domains and controlled boundary crossing
- **ADR-023:** Proposed, correction as supersession rather than deletion
- **ADR-024:** Accepted, pre-write coordination for shared-memory mutation
- **ADR-025:** Proposed, explicit authority for durable decision overwrite
- **ADR-026:** Proposed, origin is provenance rather than evidentiary authority
- **ADR-027:** Proposed, governed re-admission for rejected values
- **ADR-028:** Accepted, language-neutral core with optional implementation/interoperability profiles
- **ADR-029:** Proposed, Governance Context Projection as derived context rather than authority
- **ADR-030:** Accepted, versioned compatibility/currentness for temporal-policy projections
- **ADR-031:** Accepted, deterministic temporal commitments with separate evidence and authority layers
- **ADR-032:** Accepted, governed mutable memory structure with deterministic or explicit-human canonical structural authority
- **ADR-033:** Accepted, independent capability maturity and deterministic component/capability composition
- **ADR-034:** Proposed, procedural/skill memory as retained state rather than standing execution authority

Each Proposed ADR has its own acceptance evidence. A green implementation slice does not silently accept a doctrine decision whose ADR demands broader evidence.

## Important decision families

Rather than memorizing thirty-four filenames, think in decision families.

### Identity and provenance

Decisions about exact references, source evidence, derivation, durable traceability, and source-neutral evidence scrutiny.

### Lifecycle and persistence

Decisions about decay, consolidation, retention, correction, supersession, re-admission, forgetting, and inherited state.

### Governance and PAMA

Decisions about mutation authority, consequence classes, certification, and separating learned pressure from permission.

ADR-024 adds the shared-write coordination boundary:

```text
shared write intent
  -> pre-write claim / lease / equivalent coordination
  -> current-state and conflict validation
  -> PAMA authority evaluation
  -> durable mutation or refusal
```

A valid claim gives a writer the bounded opportunity to attempt a shared mutation. It does not grant permission to make that mutation durable. ADR-024 was accepted only after executable valid, conflicting, stale, expired, unauthorized, audit, and PAMA-non-override paths passed the repository evidence gates.

### Composition and security

Decisions about component boundaries, scope, isolation domains, privacy, trust, conflict, and multi-memory behavior.

ADR-033 establishes the component/capability composition model:

```text
component identity != capability identity

required capability + maturity/posture
  -> deterministic compatibility resolution
  -> selected/composed implementation
```

A component may expose several independently matured capabilities, and several components may expose the same capability. Hidden registration order is not an acceptable routing policy. Ambiguous overlap must be resolved deterministically or fail explicitly, and fallback cannot silently lower maturity, isolation, currentness, deletion, failure, or authority guarantees.

Capability routing remains separate from PAMA mutation authority and governed recall admission.

### Governed uncertainty and mutable structure

ADR-020 establishes the general governed-consequence boundary around uncertain, learned, heuristic, or probabilistic discovery.

ADR-032 adds a stronger rule for canonical structural mutation:

```text
probabilistic / learned structural discovery
        -> proposal
        -> deterministic impact + authority classification
        -> bounded autonomous commit OR explicit human decision
```

Memory shape may adapt. A probabilistic system may discover and recommend a better shape, but it cannot be the authority that commits canonical structural semantics. Bounded rebuild-only and additive changes may be autonomous under versioned deterministic policy. Semantic migrations, destructive changes, scope/isolation widening, and authority-bearing structure require explicit human authority unless a future Accepted ADR defines an exact narrower delegation.

Current PAMA 1.2 remains conservatively review-first for `domain_schema_mutation` until the narrower implementation evidence is earned.

See **[Governed Uncertainty](Governed-Uncertainty)** and **[Mutable Memory Fabric](Mutable-Memory-Fabric)**.

### Procedural memory and skills

ADR-034 proposes a separate boundary for retained procedures:

```text
skill retained
  != skill retrieved
  != skill admitted / activated
  != action execution authorized
```

A remembered procedure may shape a plan after governed recall admission. It does not become standing permission to execute shell commands, repository changes, external calls, deployments, payments, or any other consequential action.

ADR-034 also distinguishes ordinary task skills from **metamemory**. A remembered routine for changing how Agent Memory extracts, consolidates, routes, retrieves, ranks, prunes, archives, or forgets memory is a memory-management/profile-change proposal. It remains subject to PAMA and ADR-032 rather than applying itself because it was recalled.

Issue #295 owns the first executable procedural-memory acceptance path and the evidence required before ADR-034 can be promoted.

### Implementation portability

ADR-028 separates normative doctrine from implementation language and optional ecosystem profiles:

```text
normative doctrine / schemas / fixtures
        !=
reference implementation language
        !=
optional implementation or interoperability profile
```

Python, Rust, UOR, AGT, MCP, and future ecosystems may participate without becoming the definition of Agent Memory. ADR-028 is Accepted.

### Interoperability and governance projection

ADR-021 and ADR-029 preserve two different directions across an external-governance boundary:

```text
ADR-029
memory-derived context
  -> external governance decision

ADR-021
Agent Memory decision / execution evidence
  -> external verifier / attestation system
```

ADR-029's core ownership model is:

```text
Agent Memory core
  -> Governance Context Projection
  -> consumer-specific adapter
  -> governance / approval / enforcement system
```

The projection is remembered context, not standing permission or a final policy verdict. ADR-029 complements ADR-028 by keeping the projection vendor-neutral while the normative core remains language-neutral. See **[Governance Projection](Governance-Projection)**.

### Temporal policy and temporal commitments

ADR-030 requires versioned compatibility/currentness before memory-derived context is treated as current input for a temporal or authorization consumer.

ADR-031 establishes deterministic temporal commitments while keeping historical identity, evidence, lifecycle currentness, and PAMA authority distinct.

See **[Temporal Commitments](Cryptographic-Temporal-Commitments)** for the reader-facing model and visual explanation.

## When an ADR should change

An accepted decision should be revisited when there is:

- contradictory research with material architectural consequences
- a reproducible implementation failure
- a security or privacy failure mode the decision does not contain
- a semantic incompatibility discovered in schemas or composition
- evidence that a simpler architecture satisfies the same constraints
- new interoperability requirements that invalidate the original boundary

Preference alone is not enough. Neither is “the new framework has a nicer README.”

## Proposing a decision change

A strong proposal states:

1. current decision
2. new evidence or failure mode
3. proposed replacement or clarification
4. affected docs, schemas, fixtures, and implementations
5. compatibility impact
6. falsification/rejection criteria

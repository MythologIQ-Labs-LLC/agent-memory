"""Parked verification state: ADR-037 implementation, step 1 of 4.

A proposal that policy refuses is not, today, recorded anywhere. The refusal
returns and the attempt evaporates. ADR-037 holds that fail-closed cannot mean
a dead end under full automation -- a refusal must leave behind a record that
names what was refused, why, and which route out remains open.

This module builds that record and nothing else.

What it deliberately does NOT do, because ADR-037 fixes the order:

  step 2  evidence qualification and dependence lineage -- not here
  step 3  governed resumption -- **nothing in this module discharges a park**
  step 4  fail-closed ``require_review`` -- ``policy._apply_review`` is untouched

There is no ``resume``. Not as a stub, not raising ``NotImplementedError``.
A stub is an invitation; its absence is a statement. A parked proposal carries
no authority, and the type is shaped so that misreading it as authority takes
deliberate effort rather than a moment's inattention (ADR-037 section 5).

Parking is for refusals **with a route**. The envelope has three states, and
only the middle band parks::

    allow / allow_with_ledger    nothing was refused                   refuse
    require_review               enter_pending_verification permitted  park
    require_external_verificat.  request_external_verification granted park
    block                        enter_pending_verification PROHIBITED refuse

The two ends are refused for different reasons. Parking a permitted proposal
would manufacture a governance record for an event that did not occur. Parking
a blocked one would contradict the envelope being recorded -- ``_envelope``
names ``enter_pending_verification`` in the *prohibited* set for ``block`` --
and would create a record that can never leave the parked state, since no
evidence discharges an absorbing block.

The record retains the whole ``Proposal``, not a summary of it. Step 3 must
re-evaluate policy from scratch, ``policy.evaluate`` takes a ``Proposal``, and
the floors and modifiers read fields no identity summary preserves. Retaining
the proposal is also what carries ``state_snapshot`` forward, so resumption can
apply the staleness guard -- the specific risk parking introduces, since
parking is by definition a delay.

Parked records have no eviction path in this cycle. Retention belongs to #363.

Stdlib apart from the canonical schema validation reached through ``receipts``.

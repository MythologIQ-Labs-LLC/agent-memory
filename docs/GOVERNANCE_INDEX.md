# Governance Index

**Last Reviewed**: 2026-09-04

A single authoritative map of every governance artifact in this project, organized
into six freshness tiers with explicit drift contracts. A stale entry here is
itself a Tier 1 drift bug, so the index is self-policing.

The tier model and drift contracts come from Qor-logic, the gated prompt-logic
system used to facilitate development of this repository. Qor-logic is a
development-time governance toolkit only: it is **not** a runtime, build, or test
dependency of Agent Memory, it ships no code into this package, and nothing in
`reference/` imports it. The `agent-memory-reference` distribution depends on
`jsonschema`, `cryptography`, and `rfc8785` (plus the optional `comparators`
extra) and on nothing else. Paths of the form `qor/...` cited in governance
documents here refer to that external toolkit's own repository, not to any
directory in this one.

## Tier 1 — Canonical Source

MUST be current at every cycle close. Drift signal: wrong version / wrong state / missing recent entries.

| Artifact | Path | Freshness marker |
|----------|------|------------------|
| Meta Ledger | `docs/META_LEDGER.md` | Entries #1-#10; Sprint 1 seal Entry #8; #9 migration attestation, #10 amendment (2026-09-04). `verify-ledger` exit 0, all 10 entries OK |
| System State | `docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md` | Sprint 1 snapshot, iteration 1 |
| Concept | `docs/CONCEPT.md` | stable; hashed into genesis; owner decision: "supported runtime" is the 1.0 objective |
| Architecture Plan | `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` | Dependencies table and file tree synced at Sprint 1; risk grade L3 |
| Backlog | `docs/BACKLOG.md` | B1-B4 open; B5 complete |
| Feature Index | `docs/FEATURE_INDEX.md` | 11 entries, 11 verified (FX001-FX011) |
| Shadow Genome | `docs/SHADOW_GENOME.md` | 5 entries, 4 resolved |
| Process Shadow Genome | `docs/PROCESS_SHADOW_GENOME.md` | append-only JSONL of process events (capability shortfalls, gate skips, overrides) |
| Changelog | `CHANGELOG.md` | **absent** (GAP-REL-01, Sprint 8); register here when created |
| README | `README.md` | Conformance badge spec-scoped (Sprint 1); installable distribution (Loop 7); **ownership section** — contracts are Agent Memory's, implementations live here (2026-09-04) |
| Roadmap events | `.qor/roadmaps/agent-memory-1_0-completion/events.jsonl` | 32 events; 7 frontier nodes open |

## Tier 2 — Doctrine & Policy

Stable; changes are explicit doctrine events. Drift signal: rules contradict each other or operator memory.

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| ADR index (canonical status) | `docs/adr/README.md` (31 Accepted, 6 Proposed) |
| ADRs | `docs/adr/ADR-001` through `ADR-037` |
| PAMA foundation | `docs/pama/README.md`, `docs/04-governance-and-pama.md`, `docs/33-pama-decision-table.md` |
| Memory threat model | `docs/15-memory-threat-model.md` |
| Source rights policy | `docs/SOURCE_RIGHTS_POLICY.md` |
| Evidence promotion policy | `docs/policies/EVIDENCE_PROMOTION.md` |
| Project governance | `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `.github/CODEOWNERS` |
| Schemas (contracts) | `schemas/*.schema.json` (58); registry at `docs/27-schema-registry-and-type-evolution.md` (8 listed, GAP-SC-04) |

## Tier 3 — Active Initiative

Live until close; ages out at substantiate. Drift signal: shipped feature still tracked as pending.

| Artifact | Path | Opened |
|----------|------|--------|
| Deep-audit research brief | `docs/RESEARCH_BRIEF.md` | 2026-09-01 |
| Agent Memory 1.0 roadmap | `.qor/roadmaps/agent-memory-1_0-completion/` | 2026-09-01 |
| QOR Agent proving ground | GitHub issue #332 | 2026-08-22 |
| Genesis branch | `feat/agent-memory-genesis` | 2026-09-01 |

## Tier 4 — Per-Plan Artifact

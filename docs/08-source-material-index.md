# Source Material Index

## Purpose

This index records external and related conceptual systems that informed, challenged, implemented, or provided provenance context for Agent Memory doctrine, and points to external research evidence used to challenge, extend, or validate those concepts.

It is not a complete bibliography. Native Agent Memory doctrine, implementation provenance, and external scientific evidence are deliberately separated so a repo-specific idea does not quietly acquire the authority of neuroscience merely because both happen to use the word "memory."

For the interdisciplinary literature map, see [`23-research-bibliography.md`](23-research-bibliography.md).

For copyright, license, attribution, and reuse handling, see [`SOURCE_RIGHTS_POLICY.md`](SOURCE_RIGHTS_POLICY.md) and the machine-readable [`source registry`](../sources/source-registry.json).

Research in this repository is not decorative citation inventory. Its job is to improve, constrain, or falsify architectural claims.

## Native Agent Memory doctrine

Some foundational concepts are authored as part of Agent Memory itself and therefore are **not external source records**.

### Proportional Adaptive Mutation Authority (PAMA)

PAMA is native Agent Memory governance doctrine authored by **Kevin R. Knapp**. It does not require an external provenance link or a source-rights registry entry merely because it has an identifiable conceptual origin.

The systems-agnostic PAMA foundation is maintained in [`pama/README.md`](pama/README.md). Agent Memory specializes that foundation through:

- [`04-governance-and-pama.md`](04-governance-and-pama.md)
- [`33-pama-decision-table.md`](33-pama-decision-table.md)
- [`34-adapter-contracts.md`](34-adapter-contracts.md)
- [`36-policy-as-memory.md`](36-policy-as-memory.md)
- [`38-human-correction-ux-contract.md`](38-human-correction-ux-contract.md)
- [`adr/ADR-004-pama-controls-mutation-authority.md`](adr/ADR-004-pama-controls-mutation-authority.md)
- [`adr/ADR-020-probabilistic-discovery-deterministic-governance.md`](adr/ADR-020-probabilistic-discovery-deterministic-governance.md)

External standards, research, and implementations may support, challenge, benchmark, align with, or implement PAMA. They do not become the source of PAMA by doing so.

## Public-source and reuse rule

> **When an external or related source has a lawful, stable public locator, link the most specific authoritative artifact available. Public accessibility does not imply reuse permission.**

The repository distinguishes:

- **native doctrine**: contributor-authored doctrine owned and maintained by Agent Memory
- **provenance**: where an external idea, implementation, proposal, or evidence claim came from
- **accessibility**: whether contributors can inspect that source directly
- **rights status**: what license, permission, authorship, or uncertainty governs reuse of its expression
- **reuse mode**: citation, independent synthesis, author-originated reuse, licensed reuse, or permission-based reuse

A related public artifact must not be substituted for a private canonical source merely to make the index look complete.

Unknown external rights status defaults to **citation and independent synthesis only**.

External or private projects should appear here only when they add specific provenance, implementation, challenge, or evidence value. Mere conceptual adjacency is not enough.

### UOR provenance note

[UOR Framework issue #2](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/UOR-Framework/issues/2) was opened by Kevin R. Knapp.

The **"thermodynamic ground state" framing as used in that memory-lifecycle proposal is recorded here as a Kevin R. Knapp contribution**. This is an authorship/provenance statement. It does not depend on claiming that the short phrase or underlying concept is exclusively protectable under copyright, trademark, patent, or another body of law.

The issue thread also contains third-party contributions. Those contributions retain their own source and rights posture and must not be treated as Kevin-originated merely because they appear in the same thread.

## Research accessibility preference

When two sources are comparably useful, prefer material contributors can inspect without proprietary access barriers.

Preferred source classes include:

- open-access journal articles
- PubMed Central and equivalent lawful public archives
- author-hosted manuscripts where lawful
- arXiv and other lawful preprint repositories
- open conference proceedings
- public technical reports
- open datasets and benchmark repositories
- standards and government publications

This is a preference, not a rule that lower-quality open material outranks stronger evidence.

A paywalled or proprietary source may inform research when lawfully available, but the doctrine should avoid depending materially on a claim that maintainers and contributors cannot independently inspect when a credible accessible alternative exists.

**Open access is not itself a reuse license.** A source can be freely readable while still restricting reproduction of its prose, figures, tables, diagrams, or other expression.

## Research evidence roles

Every external source should be used in one or more explicit roles:

```text
SUPPORT
Evidence consistent with an existing doctrine claim.

CHALLENGE
Evidence that weakens, limits, or contradicts a doctrine claim.

BOUNDARY
Evidence showing the claim is valid only under specific conditions.

MECHANISM
Evidence about how memory behaves in its native biological/cognitive/computational substrate.

FAILURE MODE
Evidence of a practical attack, brittleness, benchmark failure, or operational risk.

DESIGN CANDIDATE
A plausible engineering approach that has not yet earned doctrine status.
```

A source can play multiple roles.

## Research challenge rule

For consequential doctrine candidates, actively search for evidence that would make the claim less convenient.

For governed uncertainty, relevant challenges include:

- fixed deterministic thresholds can be brittle or miscalibrated
- stochastic or learned retrieval may outperform static rules
- adaptive defenses may be required when attacks are contextual or compositional
- probabilistic safety guarantees may sometimes be the strongest available formal guarantee
- exact replay of stochastic cognition may be impossible while policy and consequence replay remain achievable
- deterministic execution can reproduce the same wrong decision indefinitely

The purpose is not to manufacture false balance. It is to avoid mistaking architectural preference for evidence.

- [`adr/ADR-005-codegenome-is-code-reality-substrate.md`](adr/ADR-005-codegenome-is-code-reality-substrate.md)

## COREFORGE Vault / Neurospace

Canonical historical provenance is private. [GG-CORE](https://github.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/GG-CORE) is a public successor/continuation and may be used for current public implementation context, but it must not be presented as the originating COREFORGE source.

Relevant ideas:

- local-first memory runtime
- encrypted Vault storage
- knowledge graph and RAG recall
- context window assembly
- governed autonomy
- agent-facing runtime memory

Doctrine placement:

- [`01-layer-model.md`](01-layer-model.md)
- [`04-governance-and-pama.md`](04-governance-and-pama.md)
- [`adr/ADR-006-neurospace-is-runtime-memory-space.md`](adr/ADR-006-neurospace-is-runtime-memory-space.md)

## Native doctrine: PAMA

PAMA is maintained directly by Agent Memory rather than represented as an external provenance source.

Canonical entry point:

- [`pama/README.md`](pama/README.md)

Relevant doctrine:

- proportional adaptive mutation authority
- M0-M5 mutation target classes
- lifecycle strength
- A0-A5 downstream authority classes
- adaptive charters
- proportional handling lanes
- reusable capability authority ceilings
- evidence, lineage, correction, revocation, and consequence-proportional governance

Agent Memory's memory-specific specialization is in [`04-governance-and-pama.md`](04-governance-and-pama.md) and [`33-pama-decision-table.md`](33-pama-decision-table.md).

No external source-rights entry is required for PAMA itself. Any external research, standard, or implementation reused to support or challenge PAMA remains separately governed by this source policy.

## FailSafe / Arbiter

Primary provenance:

- [VerdictArbiter implementation](https://github.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/FailSafe/blob/main/FailSafe/extension/src/sentinel/VerdictArbiter.ts)
- [FailSafe repository](https://github.com/MythologIQ-Labs-LLC/FailSafe)

Relevant ideas:

- evidence capture
- policy gates
- approval boundaries
- verdict arbitration
- audit trails

Agent Memory independently expresses the governance doctrine. Directly copied or adapted Apache-2.0 material would require the applicable attribution, license, NOTICE, and modification obligations to be recorded and satisfied.

## Evidence-transfer rule

When moving an idea between biological, cognitive, and agentic domains, classify the transfer:

```text
MECHANISM
Demonstrated in the original substrate.

FUNCTIONAL ANALOGY
A similar problem or role appears in another substrate.

ENGINEERING PRESCRIPTION
A software requirement justified independently by agent evidence, governance, or operational risk.

OPEN HYPOTHESIS
A design idea that still requires validation.
```

Do not turn functional analogy into claimed mechanism.

For example:

```text
Biological systems show adaptive forgetting.
```

may support the hypothesis that selective forgetting can help an artificial memory system.

It does **not** establish that a specific decay equation, vector-store TTL, or pruning algorithm is biologically correct.

Likewise:

```text
Human memory retrieval is probabilistic or uncertainty-aware.
```

may support preserving uncertainty in agent-memory reasoning.

It does **not** prove that a particular neural network, confidence threshold, or stochastic planner is the correct software implementation.

## Source-record fields

When an external research claim materially affects doctrine, the research map should be able to record:

```text
source_ref
source_class
accessibility
publication_or_release_date
claim_used
role: support | challenge | boundary | mechanism | failure_mode | design_candidate
transfer_class: mechanism | functional_analogy | engineering_prescription | open_hypothesis
limitations
related_doctrine
related_fixture_or_test
reviewed_at
```

When external source material is materially reused rather than merely cited or independently synthesized, the rights record should additionally retain:

```text
public_url
copyright_owner_or_originator
license_or_rights_status
license_url_or_permission_ref
reuse_mode
material_reused
attribution_required
notice_required
modification_notice_required
reuse_basis
verified_at
```

The repository need not turn into citation-management software. It does need enough evidence to distinguish external research provenance from permission to copy.

External and materially reused source-rights records live in [`../sources/source-registry.json`](../sources/source-registry.json) and are validated against [`../schemas/source-record.schema.json`](../schemas/source-record.schema.json).

External research listed in [`23-research-bibliography.md`](23-research-bibliography.md) defaults to citation and independent synthesis unless material reuse is explicitly registered.

## Doctrine challenge ledger

A doctrine candidate should retain both supporting and challenging evidence until the question is resolved or explicitly left open.

For governed uncertainty, the ledger should track at least:

```text
claim: uncertain inference may be probabilistic while authority remains bounded
supporting_evidence: ...
challenging_evidence: ...
known_boundary_conditions: ...
implementation_evidence: ...
conformance_evidence: ...
current_status: proposed | supported | revised | rejected | unresolved
```

This prevents the bibliography from becoming a one-way machine for proving whatever we already wanted to believe.

## Open consolidation questions

1. Should saturation be represented as one scalar or a vector of durability dimensions?
2. Should PAMA authority be evaluated before or after saturation reaches candidate threshold?
3. How should certification expire or be renewed?
4. How should Neurospace expose disputed memory to agents without allowing canonical misuse?
5. Which memory types require human approval before crystallization?
6. What is the minimum viable conformance fixture schema?
7. How should CodeGenome graph confidence flow into general agent memory saturation?
8. How should episodic memory be consolidated into semantic or procedural memory without losing behavior-changing exceptions?
9. Which forgetting mechanisms should be reversible, and which require irreversible deletion?
10. How should prospective memory connect to schedulers and automation systems without conflating memory with execution?
11. How should inherited memory identify acquisition mode and authority?
12. How should memory-guided action be benchmarked separately from conversational recall?
13. Which estimator outputs require formal calibration and which are better represented categorically?
14. When is deterministic policy too brittle and a formally bounded probabilistic guarantee more appropriate?
15. Which forms of stochastic action are acceptable after governance creates the permitted action set?
16. How should unsafe behavior emerging only from memory composition be represented and tested?
17. What evidence is sufficient to move ADR-020 from Proposed to Accepted?
18. Which external sources currently require explicit reuse-rights review because repository content moved beyond citation or independent synthesis?

## Maintenance rule

When a new memory-system idea appears, first determine whether it is:

```text
native Agent Memory doctrine
external evidence
external implementation provenance
cross-domain analogy
conformance evidence
```

Then place the idea in one or more architecture categories before adding implementation work:

```text
identity
evidence
source trust
encoding / admission
content type
saturation
uncertainty
lifecycle
consolidation
retrieval
governance
certification
runtime
correction
forgetting
inheritance
conformance
```

For external material, apply the source-rights gate:

1. link the most specific lawful public source when one exists
2. identify whether the source is public, private, a successor, or lacks a public locator
3. separate provenance from reuse rights
4. default unknown rights to citation and independent synthesis
5. register any material quotation, adaptation, or copy before merge
6. preserve applicable attribution, notice, and modification obligations
7. never substitute an adjacent public artifact for private canonical provenance

Native contributor-authored doctrine does not need to be manufactured into an external source merely to satisfy this index. Its authorship and canonical location should be recorded in the doctrine tree itself.

If the idea does not fit the architecture taxonomy, determine whether the taxonomy is genuinely incomplete before creating a new component. Architectural sprawl remains undefeated at naming things humans find interesting.

# Agent Memory Documentation

This directory is the canonical documentation map for the Agent Memory reference architecture.

The repository is intentionally layered. Start with the smallest path that answers your question, then follow links deeper. Reading all thirty-nine numbered documents in numerical order is legal, but there are more humane options.

## Native PAMA doctrine

**Proportional Adaptive Mutation Authority (PAMA)** is native Agent Memory doctrine authored by **Kevin R. Knapp**.

Start with [`pama/README.md`](pama/README.md) for the systems-agnostic foundation:

- adaptation is not authority
- memory is not procedure
- procedure is not permission
- permission is not governance
- M0-M5 mutation target classes
- lifecycle strength
- A0-A5 downstream authority classes
- proportional handling lanes
- adaptive charters
- capability authority ceilings

Then use [`04-governance-and-pama.md`](04-governance-and-pama.md) and [`33-pama-decision-table.md`](33-pama-decision-table.md) for the Agent Memory specialization.

PAMA is not represented as an external source dependency. External research, standards, and implementations that support or challenge PAMA retain separate provenance and source-rights treatment.

### Source rights and provenance

- [`SOURCE_RIGHTS_POLICY.md`](SOURCE_RIGHTS_POLICY.md) defines citation, synthesis, author-originated, licensed, and permission-based reuse modes.
- [`../sources/source-registry.json`](../sources/source-registry.json) records external/private/material-reuse source posture.
- [`../schemas/source-record.schema.json`](../schemas/source-record.schema.json) makes those source-rights records machine-checkable.

The default for external sources is citation plus independent synthesis. Public readability is not treated as an open license, and private canonical provenance is not replaced with convenient but inaccurate public substitutes.

Native contributor-authored doctrine does not need to masquerade as an external source. Its authorship and canonical location belong in the doctrine tree.

## Architecture Decision Records

See [`adr/README.md`](adr/README.md).

Current doctrine state:

```text
ADR-001 through ADR-019: Accepted
ADR-020: Proposed
```

ADR-020 remains Proposed because it explicitly requires real end-to-end runtime evidence, including repeated behavioral evidence for stochastic containment. Documentation, schemas, and structurally valid fixtures are necessary but not sufficient.

## Governed-uncertainty audit trail

The repository preserves baseline and post-remediation evidence rather than overwriting history with the pleasant fiction that the doctrine was always this coherent.

Audit records live in [`audits/governed-uncertainty/`](audits/governed-uncertainty/).

Repository CI runs the same validation through [`../.github/workflows/validate-doctrine-evidence.yml`](../.github/workflows/validate-doctrine-evidence.yml).

## Evidence posture

Research may support, challenge, narrow, or reject an architectural idea.

Prefer freely inspectable research where practical, but do not let accessibility outrank evidence quality. Biological and cognitive research should be classified as native mechanism, functional analogy, engineering prescription, or open hypothesis before it is transferred into software doctrine.

Evidence availability and reuse permission remain separate questions. External research sources are citation/synthesis-only by default unless material reuse has an explicit rights record.

The repository's job is not to collect citations until an idea looks inevitable. Its job is to make assumptions inspectable enough that good evidence can change them without making the repository a rights-management guessing game.
